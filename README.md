# Easy Catalogue
Easy Catalogue is a 2nd-year university project that demonstrates agile development principles in action. This innovative project revolves around the creation of a user-friendly cataloging web service, which integrates product-rich content from the IceCat external API. With Easy Catalogue, users can effortlessly populate their catalogues, streamlining their product management tasks.

## Highlights
- **Expressive Server Development:** We crafted a server using Express.js, enabling it to serve web pages and interact with external APIs. This server forms the backbone of the Easy Catalogue system.
- **Intuitive Browser-Based GUI:** The project boasts a user-friendly browser-based graphical user interface (GUI) that empowers users to harness the server's features and make edits with ease. The intuitive interface enhances the overall user experience.
- **Universal Catalogue Layout:** Easy Catalogue adheres to a universally accepted catalogue layout, ensuring familiarity for users from various backgrounds. This layout enhances usability.

The Easy Catalogue project showcases agile development practices and an ability to create web services that simplify complex tasks. By integrating external API data, we have created a practical solution for users seeking efficient and user-friendly product cataloging tools.
