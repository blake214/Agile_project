There are two methods i found. (follow the json link and that give the data for that product, check it out)

JSON data for a product:
https://live.icecat.biz/api/?UserName=openIcecat-live&Language=en&Brand=hp&ProductCode=259J1EA#ABB 

XML data for a product
https://data.icecat.biz/xml_s3/xml_server3.cgi?prod_id=RJ459AV;vendor=hp;lang=en;output=productxml


//////
The JSON way looks the easiest, as doesnt ask for any password
- Takes two main arguments
- Brand : the brand name (in the above is HP)
- product code : this is indicated on the icecat product page "product code" (in the above is 259J1EA#ABB)

//////
So a method i think will work is getting the brand name and product code from the user
then placing that into the url string, then we get our JSON data

Then we just need to get the data we want out of it
